Millions of us - renters and small businesses, restaurant workers and domestic workers, students and teachers and now ARTISTS - are joining together because we refuse to go back to a world with insurmountable debt, insecure and unsafe jobs, homelessness, detention and housing instability. We are joining together to go beyond recovery and to secure a future where we guarantee healthy stable and thriving communities for all.

**Will you join us to #Cancel Rent?**
