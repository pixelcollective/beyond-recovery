title: "Artists For #CancelRent"
description: Millions of us - renters and small businesses, restaurant workers
  and domestic workers, students and teachers and now ARTISTS - are joining
  together because we refuse to go back to a world with insurmountable debt,
  insecure and unsafe jobs, homelessness, detention and housing instability. We
  are joining together to go beyond recovery and to secure a future where we
  guarantee healthy stable and thriving communities for all.
