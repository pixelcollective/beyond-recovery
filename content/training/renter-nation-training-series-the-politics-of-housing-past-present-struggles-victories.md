title: "Renter Nation Training Series - The Politics of Housing: Past & Present
  Struggles & Victories"
description: "This year's RNTS is working to facilitate the political education
  and organizing skills of people who have been impacted by this moment, to
  deepen our collective capacity to build intersectional, multi-issue movements
  to build the strategy & power we need to cancel rent and win transformative
  change.  Todayâ€™s call is called The Politics of Housing: Past and Present
  Struggles and Victories, and will focus on the history of the housing movement
  in the US, as well as using rent strikes as a tactic."
