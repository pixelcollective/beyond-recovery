title: "Renter Nation Training Series- The Great Land Robbery: Land & Housing
  under Racial Capitalism"
description: "This year's RNTS is working to facilitate the political education
  and organizing skills of people who have been impacted by this moment, to
  deepen our collective capacity to build intersectional, multi-issue movements
  to build the strategy & power we need to cancel rent and win transformative
  change. Today’s call is called The Great Land Robbery: Land & Housing under
  Racial Capitalism, and will focus on how race structures our relationship to
  land and access to housing.   _______"
