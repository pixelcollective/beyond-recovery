description: This year's RNTS is working to support the political education and
  skills development of people who have been impacted by this moment of crisis.
  The series is geared towards increasing our collective capacity to build
  intersectional, multi-issue groups and campaigns so that we grow the power we
  need to cancel rent and win long-term transformative change. This training
  will focus on the basics of community organizing.
