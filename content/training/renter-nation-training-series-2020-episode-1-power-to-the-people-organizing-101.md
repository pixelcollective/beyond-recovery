  Organizing 101"

  and organizing skills of people who have been impacted by this moment, to
  deepen our collective capacity to build intersectional, multi-issue movements
  to build the strategy & power we need to cancel rent and win transformative
  change. Todayâ€™s call is called Power to the People: Organizing 101, and will
  focus on the basics of community organizing."
